Django ORM Standalone Template
==============================

Authors - Dan Caron, Abu Ashraf Masnun

This is a Django project template that allows you to use the database component of Django without having to use the rest of Django (i.e. running a web server). Now you can write regular python scripts and use Django's excellent database functionality.

Requirements
------------
This repository doesn't ship with a Django installation. The system must have an existing django installation so that we can safely import required modules. Developed on Python 2.7 and Django 1.4.0.

Quick Setup
-----------

+ 1.) Inside settings.py - Edit your database settings
+ 2.) Inside db/models.py - Setup your models

__main.py is the file where you start coding your project.__ Think of it like a plain old python file, but now with the power of Django's database functionality! Feel free to send pull requests if you want to improve this project.
